what is the hospital system provide ?!

-In this busy world we don’t have the time to wait in infamously long hospital queues.
The problem is, queuing at hospital is often managed manually by administrative staff,
then take a token there and then wait for our turn then ask for the doctor and the most
frustrating thing - we went there by traveling a long distance and then we come to know
the doctor is on leave or the doctor can’t take appointments.
HMS will help us overcome all these problems because now patients can book their
appointments at home, they can check whether the doctor they want to meet is
available or not. Doctors can also confirm or decline appointments, this help both
patient and the doctor because if the doctor declines’ appointment then patient will
know this in advance and patient will visit hospital only when the doctor confirms’ the
appointment this will save time and money of the patient.
Patients can also pay the doctor’s consultant fee online to save their time.
